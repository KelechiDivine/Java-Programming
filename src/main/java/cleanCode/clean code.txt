When the code works, that's when you have to clean it. 
Because no one writes clean code first. It is too hard to get a code to work;
When the code works It will be a mess.... Human being don't think in a staight line at first.

The only way to go fast is to go well

You don't write noun as a function name: Function names should be a verb, because functions 
do things (they do thing : They perform an action)

-----------Functions------------
1: Functions should  not be 100 lines long.
2: Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long (write a polite code)

---- Second rule of function----

1: A function should be small
2: They should be smaller than that

A function should do one thing. Your function should not be less than 6 lines.
The function shouldn't take more than two or maximum three argument.
Don't pass boolean in your functions. Make sure your code isn't surprising 


--------Comment-------
1: The proper use of comment is :
	a: To compensate for our failure to express ourselves in code.

2: Every use of a comment represent a failure.
	a: So don''t comment first. Try everything else, then 
	   comment as a resort

Let all your local variable begin with 'a'(aDate)
All of the argument to a function begins with a 'var' (varFirstNumber)
All instance variable begin with 'its' (itsBoy)
