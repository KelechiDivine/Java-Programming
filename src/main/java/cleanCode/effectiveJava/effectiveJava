A class can have only a single constructor with a given signature.

Different between constructor and static methods -->

1: Unlike constructors, they have names.

2: Unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time they're
    invoked.

3: Unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype f their return type.

4: A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object
    can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.

5: A fifth advantage of static factories is that class of the returned object need not
    exist when the class containing the method is written.
